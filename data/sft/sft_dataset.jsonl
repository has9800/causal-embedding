{"text": "Prompt: A city bans leaded fuel. Explain health impact.\nTrace: Lead particles decrease in air, reducing chronic exposure, which lowers neurological harm in children. Therefore the ban causes better public health outcomes."}
{"text": "Prompt: Heavy rainfall is followed by landslides. Explain causality.\nTrace: Rain saturates soil, increases pore pressure, weakens slope cohesion, and triggers slope failure. So rainfall causes landslides under susceptible terrain conditions."}
